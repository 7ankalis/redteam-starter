# ðŸ’€ redteam-starter

A humble collection of notes and chaos from my first steps into the world of Red Teaming, EDR/AV evasion and whatever catches my attention and curiosity in between.
This repo is my personal dump of everything I learn (when I remember to push it and when I donâ€™t procrastinate too hard).

### WTF is this
Everything in here is my dump while I'm learning from other rich resources done by much more experimented and seasoned people in the industry.
So while I write down and collect what I learn, I'd like to share it in here before going back to the CPTS path.
